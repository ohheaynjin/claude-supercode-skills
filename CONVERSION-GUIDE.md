    └── SKILL.md
```


### Phase 3: Skill Creation (COMPLETED)

**Conversion Approach:**

Each skill follows this structure:

1. **YAML Frontmatter**

```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: Third-person description with trigger keywords
   ---
   ```


2. **Purpose Section**
   - Clear statement of what skill does
   - Philosophy and guiding principles

3. **When to Use Section**
   - Specific trigger scenarios
   - Clear use cases

4. **Core Capabilities**
   - Detailed capabilities list
   - Behavioral traits
   - Tool usage strategies

5. **Example Interactions**
   - Real-world usage examples
   - Common query patterns

### Phase 4: Validation (COMPLETED)

**Validation Checklist Applied:**
- ✅ Frontmatter has required `name` and `description`
- ✅ Description is third-person with trigger keywords
- ✅ SKILL.md body under 500 lines
- ✅ Progressive disclosure implemented
- ✅ No auxiliary documentation files
- ✅ Clear behavioral traits and use cases

## Best Practices Applied

### 1. Conciseness Over Verbosity

**Principle:** Every token competes with other context.

**Implementation:**
- Main SKILL.md files kept under 500 lines
- Essential guidance only in main file
- Detailed content moved to reference files (when needed)
- No redundant or filler content

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

**Principle:** Load only what's needed, when it's needed.

**Implementation:**
- Level 1: Metadata (name + description) - always in context
- Level 2: SKILL.md body - loaded when skill triggers
- Level 3: Reference files - loaded as needed

**Examples:**
```markdown
## Quick Start
Basic information here...

## Advanced Topics
For detailed API docs, see [reference/api.md](reference/api.md)
For examples, see [reference/examples.md](reference/examples.md)
```


### 3. Third-Person Descriptions

**Principle:** Claude uses descriptions to decide whether to trigger skills.

**Implementation:**
- ❌ "I help with..."
- ✅ "Expert at..."
- ❌ "Use me when..."
- ✅ "Use when user asks..."

**Examples:**
- `description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user asks "how does this work?"`

### 4. Tool Restrictions

**Principle:** Only include what's necessary to minimize attack surface.

**Implementation:**
- `allowed-tools` scoped to minimum required tools
- Wildcard patterns used appropriately (e.g., `Bash(git:*)`)
- Read-only skills have `Read, Grep, Glob` only

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Read-only analysis
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob

# Git operations only
allowed-tools: "Bash(git status:*),Bash(git diff:*),Read,Grep"

# Python scripts in skill dir
allowed-tools: "Bash(python scripts/*:*),Read,Write"
```


### 5. Naming Conventions

**Principle:** Descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose.

**Implementation:**
- Gerund form: `processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-data`
- Action-oriented: `process-pdfs`, `analyze-spreadsheets`
- Noun phrases: `pdf-processing`, `code-exploration`

**Avoided:**
- Generic: `helper`, `utils`, `tools`
- Reserved: `anthropic-helper`, `claude-tools`

### 6. Manual Invocation Markers

**Principle:** Clearly indicate skills that should only be manually invoked.

**Implementation:**
- Build and Plan agents have explicit markers
- Description states "Manual invocation only"
- Multiple reminders in behavioral traits section

**Example:**
```yaml
---
name: strategic-planning
description: Strategic planning specialist. Manual invocation only - expert at decomposing complex projects into manageable tasks. Use when starting complex projects or requiring systematic task management.
---
```


## Skill Conversion Patterns

### Pattern 1: Expertise-Based Skills

**Examples:** explore, oracle, librarian

**Structure:**
1. Deep domain expertise description
2. Multi-level search capabilities (quick, medium, very thorough)
3. Research methodologies
4. Tool usage strategies
5. Example interactions

### Pattern 2: Capability-Based Skills

**Examples:** frontend-ui-ux-engineer, document-writer

**Structure:**
1. Design philosophy or approach
2. Core capabilities list
3. Technical preferences or frameworks
4. Behavioral traits
5. When-to-use guidelines
6. Example scenarios

### Pattern 3: Task-Oriented Skills

**Examples:** build, plan

**Structure:**
1. Manual invocation emphasis
2. Task execution patterns
3. Workflow or methodology
4. Tool requirements
5. Common use cases

### Pattern 4: Analysis Skills

**Examples:** multimodal-looker

**Structure:**
1. Analysis approach (interpretation vs extraction)
2. Supported media types
3. Analysis methodologies
4. Specific use cases
5. Output patterns

## Key Insights

### 1. Context Window Management

**Finding:** Skills must be extremely concise to be practical.

**Implementation:**
- Target: < 500 lines per SKILL.md
- Strategy: Progressive disclosure for detailed content
- Benefit: Skills remain lightweight and fast to load

### 2. Agent vs. Skill Differences

**Finding:** Skills add knowledge; agents execute in separate contexts.

**Implications:**
- Skills focus on guidance and patterns
- Subagents have separate tool access and context
- Convert agent "what" into skill "how"
- Don't try to replicate agent isolation in skills

### 3. Auto-Discovery Mechanics

**Finding:** Description quality determines whether skills trigger automatically.

**Implementation:**
- Include specific trigger keywords
- Use third-person perspective
- Cover multiple natural language phrasings
- Be explicit about "when to use"

### 4. Tool Access Patterns

**Finding:** Different agent types have different tool requirements.

**Examples:**
- Read-only agents: `Read, Grep, Glob`
- Development agents: `Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep`
- Research agents: `Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch`

## Validation & Testing

### Testing Framework

Created comprehensive validation guide (`SKILL-VALIDATION-GUIDE.md`) covering:

1. **Frontmatter Validation**
   - Required fields present
   - Naming conventions followed
   - Description effectiveness

2. **Content Validation**
   - Structure and formatting
   - Line count constraints
   - Content quality

3. **Functionality Validation**
   - Basic loading test
   - Auto-discovery test
   - Execution test
   - Reference loading test
   - Error handling test
   - Tool restrictions test

### Common Issues Identified

**Issue 1: Skills Not Triggering**
- **Cause:** Vague descriptions lacking trigger keywords
- **Fix:** Add specific terms users would naturally say

**Issue 2: Context Too Large**
- **Cause:** SKILL.md files too verbose
- **Fix:** Use progressive disclosure, move details to references

**Issue 3: Tool Restrictions Too Strict**
- **Cause:** `allowed-tools` overly limited
- **Fix:** Review and expand with scoped wildcards
